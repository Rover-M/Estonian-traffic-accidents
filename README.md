Dataset 1 (11.02 MB): Data on traffic accidents with human victims. 
Dataset 2 (11.74 kB): Traffic Accidents and Casualty Trends in Estonia

Goal 1: Analyzing the dataset to find which factors
(e.g., weather, time of day, road type, driver age, vehicle type, etc.)
most strongly correlate with the severity or frequency of accidents
involving human victims. 

Goal 2: Build a model to predict the number of fatal traffic accidents in
Estonia for upcoming months and years based on historical
accident data and related conditions.
