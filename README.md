# Estonian Traffic Accidents
Authors: Mia Johanna Paas and Armin Liiv

## Motivation

Traffic accidents are a major public safety issue in Estonia. Understanding the factors that contribute to accident severity and frequency can help policymakers, road safety experts, and the public to reduce risks and prevent fatalities.

## Goals

1. Factor Analysis Identify which conditions (e.g., weather, time of day, road type, driver age, vehicle type, safety equipment use) most strongly correlate with the severity or frequency of accidents involving human victims.

2. Predictive Modeling Build machine learning models to predict the number of fatal traffic accidents in Estonia for upcoming months and years based on historical accident data and related conditions.

## Datasets

1. Dataset 1 (11.02 MB): Data on traffic accidents with human victims [1]
2. Dataset 2 (11.74 kB): Traffic accidents and casualty trends in Estonia [2]
